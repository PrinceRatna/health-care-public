    "detail":"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique used to track the electrical activity of the brain through the placement of electrodes on the scalp. Clinically, EEG are often used to identify seizures, but this same technology can also be used by researchers to reveal a various brain functions and how those functions relate to human cognition and behavior. Unlike the tES techniques described above, the scalp electrodes employed during EEG are only used to record the brainâ€™s natural electrical activity; they do not deliver electrical energy to the brain. Consequently, there are no major risks associated with this entirely noninvasive brain monitoring technique."}]
