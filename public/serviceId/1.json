    "detail":"Cardiovascular surgery, also referred to as cardiac surgery or heart surgery, describes any surgical procedure that involves the heart, or the blood vessels that carry blood to and from the heart. These procedures are common with patients who have heart disease or have had a heart attack, stroke or blood clot—as well as individuals who are at high risk for developing these problems. While cardiovascular surgery isn’t always necessary to treat heart problems, doctors may recommend it for a variety of reasons, including treating or preventing heart attacks and blood clots, addressing irregular heartbeats, opening blocked or narrowed arteries, repairing congenital heart problems, and fixing damaged or diseased heart valves. Some cardiovascular conditions require open surgery, but many are treated with less invasive techniques that use catheters and robotics. Cardiovascular surgery patients are cared for by a health care team that includes a primary care doctor, cardiologist, cardiovascular surgeon, anesthesiologist and other specialists." }
