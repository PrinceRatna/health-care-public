    "detail":"In an operating department for which the most integrated function is required, cleanliness must be kept and the safety of facilities, equipment and devices must be maintained any times. Furthermore, the working environment for medical staff such as doctors and nurses must be considered from the view point of human engineering. The modular operating theatre satisfying those conditions consists of wall, ceiling and slanted panels, and is capable of incorporating not only electrical equipment, medical gas system and lighting gears but all the necessary functions and equipment at need.Modular theater has a high availability of extension providing for the introduction of new facility in the future, establishing as well an operating environment with high work ability and enough function."}]
